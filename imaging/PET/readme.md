This example defined a complete simulation for a PET application :

* The PET scanner is defined with the **cylindricalPET system**. The camera is dedicated for small animal imaging. A phoswitch system is defined. An orbiting movement of the camera is also defined. The phantom is a water box and the source is Carbon 11. The acquisition is dynamic : 6 frames of 1 seconde each.
* The PET scanner is defined with the **ECAT system**. The camera is dedicated for whole human body imaging. A dead time model is included. The phantom is a water cylinder and the source is Fluor 18. The [ECAT Library](http://www.opengatecollaboration.org/ECAT) needs to be installed on your system.

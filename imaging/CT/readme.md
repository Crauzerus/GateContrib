**CT simulation**
The CT example simulation (Figure 1) is made of an X-Rays conical source, with 6.8Â° angle emission, a CT scanner with 100x100
Silicon (0.5x0.5x1 mm3) pixels and a cylindrical phantom made of Water containing 4 balls (Aluminium, Glass, SpineBone, PVC). 
During the simulation 16,835,281 photons are detected.

There are 2 runs. Each run performs during 90 seconds. The phantom turns around its central axis at 1 deg per second.

**Building and Running AnalyzeCT.cpp**

Compile the C++ file (in the classic directory) with the following command:

`g++ -O3 `root-config -cflags -glibs` AnalyzeCT.cpp -o AnalyzeCT`

**Results**

![Figure 2: CT example simulation : Projections during the First (left) and second (right) run.](http://wiki.opengatecollaboration.org/images/7/79/CTexampleResults.png "Figure 2: CT example simulation : Projections during the First (left) and second (right) run.")

Figure 2 shows the Energy spectrum for the first and second projection (first and second run). For the first Run, from top-left to bottom-right, the plot shows the energy spectrum outside the phantom, in the phantom, behind the 2 Top balls and behind the 2 bottom balls. For the second Run, from top-left to bottom-right, the plot shows the energy spectrum behind the PVC ball, behind the Aluminium ball, behind the Glass ball and behind the Spine Bone ball.
